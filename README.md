# Is it a palindrome?  

> A simple wwebpage to determine whether a user input is a palindrome
> Palindromes are words, phrases, or sentences spelled the same forwards as backwards

Per the requirements, this exercise includes the double challenge, allowing users to check if a word, phrase, or sentence is a palindrome while ignoring uppercase, punctuation, and spaces. Below are all examples that will register as palindromes: 

```
senile felines
```
```
Noel sees Leon
```
```
A man, a plan, a canal -- Panama
```
